CAMM (Crystal Alien Map Maker)
=====================

This is the new GitHub repository for the CAMM (Crystal Alien Map Maker) project.

# What is it?

CAMM will have the ability to create maps / levels for the [Lego Mars Mission CrystAlien Conflict Game](http://marsmissionwiki.wikifoundry.com/page/CrystAlien+Conflict).

Currently it lacks the ability to load the maps into the game, but we're working on a solution for that.
